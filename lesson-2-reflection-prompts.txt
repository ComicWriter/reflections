What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you're creating the space for that repository and it will have the global variables you've established.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in that you've taken files from the working directory and made changes to them. You've now altered the previous snapshot that still exists in the repository. The staging area shows that you've made changes but you haven't added them to the repository yet...perhaps because you've gone other files to change that accompany the changes you've made in the first file/s...so that you can submit a logical change to the repository when you're ready.
